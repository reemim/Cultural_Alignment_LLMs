# Compilation of Papers on Cultural Alignment in LLMs

## Introduction
Welcome to our repository dedicated to the collection of research and papers on cultural alignment and human value alignment in Language Models. This compilation serves as a vital resource in understanding and ensuring the development of models that respect and integrate diverse cultural norms and values.

### Purpose
This repository aims to:
- Serve as a centralized resource for researchers, students, and LLM enthusiasts.
- Enhance understanding of how LLMs aligns with various human values and cultural contexts.
- Stimulate discussion and promote further research in this critical area of LLM development.
